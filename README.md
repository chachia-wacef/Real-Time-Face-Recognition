# Real-Time-Face-Recognition

For this project, I tried with several models in order to obtain the best model in terms of precision, latency, speed so that the final algorithm is the most optimized.
The final solution chosen:
  * Face detection model: ResNet10 (Dlib library)
  * Face recognition model: VGG16 (Transfer training)
It is recommended to use the GPU to run this algorithm.
